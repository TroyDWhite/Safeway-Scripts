# Safeway: FREE Offers Finder

Safeway sometimes adds FREE offers under the Just4U FREE Offers section.

If you have multiple accounts, this UI.Vision RPA (formerly Kantu) script a) logs into your account, b) checks for a FREE offer, c) adds the offer (if available), and d) outputs a .csv file that lists which accounts now have the offer loaded.

It uses a Loop method to login and log the accounts with offers, but you can also modify it to read from your accounts from a .csv file.
